# Abstract.
abstract = "Many decisions rely on past experiences. Recent research indicates that people’s choices are biased toward choosing better-remembered options, even if these options are comparatively unattractive. In the current study, we used eye tracking to compare the influence of visual attention on preferential choice between memory-based and non-memory-based decisions.
Participants completed the remember-and-decide task. In this task, they first learned
associations between screen locations and snack items. Then, they made binary choices
between snack items. These snacks were either hidden and required recall (memory-based
decisions), or they were visible (non-memory-based decisions). Remarkably, we found that
choices were more strongly influenced by attention in memory-based compared to
non-memory-based decisions. However, we did not find evidence that visual attention
mediates the memory bias on preferential choices. Finally, we adopt and expand a recently
proposed computational model to provide a comprehensive description of the role of
attention in memory-based decisions. Our work elucidates how visual attention interacts
with episodic memory and preference formation in memory-based decisions."
